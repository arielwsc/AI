The objective of Machine Learning is to try to predict 
a test instance based on the most similar single or 
group of training instances

Machine Learning creates a very compacted representation of a
regression or classification class to save as much memory as
possible without enumerating every single state

** To run: **
python BayeasianLearning.py <train-file> <test-file>
